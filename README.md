# Vehicle-Inventory-System
CS474 Course Project

This project is to design and implement a test version of a Vehicle Inventory System (VCS) on behalf of Mr. Tucker Piston who owns a car dealership business. Tucker has a number of cars (possibly from different years and manufacturers) in his parking lot. He is interested in a system that will allow him to keep track of basic information about each car (e.g., make, model, year) as well accounting information (e.g., date when car was acquired, price paid, and asking price for the car).

Each car instance will have Id, Make, Model, Year, Date, Cost, Picture. You need
to store car instances in files rather than in memory. Use SmartPointers for this.


API Endpoints:


Enter Command: c

Enter the data fields except the id as it will auto generate the id.


Enter command: l

Lists all the car objects


Enter command: 1..5

to edit the instance


Enter command: p

to update the price (not fully working)


Enter command: s

to save the instance into the file


enter command:q

to quit the vcs


Main file: client.cpp

files will be stored in the eclipse project home folder


RUN:

Open this project in Eclipse cpp and run it.
